    <p>This web application is designed to allow users to easily find businesses near them,
        as well as inform them of the quality of the location. In addition, this application
        will suggest alternative locations for the same business that have better ratings,
        as well as different businesses of higher quality. This will be done by accessing
        the APIs for Yelp and Google and displaying combined ratings and reviews. We will
        design a novel ranking algorithm, combining information from Google and Yelp.</p>
